##  Green Intelligence

**Green Intelligence** is a data-driven web application that analyzes and predicts the **energy consumption and carbon footprint of machine learning workloads** across different hardware configurations.

The project combines **regression modeling**, **interactive visualizations**, and **AI-generated sustainability insights** to help users make more environmentally responsible ML decisions.

###  Features

*  **Interactive Dashboard** – Explore energy usage and CO₂ emissions across devices and model types
*  **Regression Analysis** – Linear regression to predict energy consumption with performance metrics
*  **Predictor Tool** – Estimate energy and CO₂ emissions for custom ML workloads
*  **AI-Powered Insights** – Actionable sustainability recommendations 
*  **Modern UI** – Built with Streamlit and Plotly for a clean, interactive experience


###  Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Streamlit**
* **Pandas, NumPy**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Plotly**
* **Groq API** 

###  Project Goal

This project demonstrates how machine learning systems themselves can be evaluated for sustainability, combining data analysis, regression modeling, and responsible AI practices in a single application.
